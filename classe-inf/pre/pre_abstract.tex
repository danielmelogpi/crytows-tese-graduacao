\begin{abstract}{Using Cryptographic Web services from Mobile Devices}
  Although the encryption be known for many years the development of tools and techniques have not been sufficient to ensure its adoption by large groups of users. In this paper we propose the use of web services capable of offering encryption capabilities from mobile devices, offering an alternative so the end user can perform transport and management of its security features with more simplicity. This approach also aims to facilitate the integration with other tools that want to use such resources. These capabilities are developed maintaining the end user in total control of  his cryptography resources.
